== Description ==

A big hello from the Motive.co team, and thanks for checking us out! 

We understand the challenges of the modern retailer, and have developed Motive Commerce Search - a feature-packed, lightning-fast **product search plugin for WooCommerce** - to empower your shop's growth.

With Motive Commerce Search, you get access to **advanced filters, live search suggestions, instant insights, and the same tools used by the biggest brands.**

Or use the **Backroom** feature to easily check stock levels, monitor trends, and optimise your store without leaving your shop’s search bar. Simply login via your shop’s search bar and see product clicks, stock levels, add to carts and more overlaid onto search results. 

✅ Unmatched search relevancy
✅ Trust-first, tracker free technology
✅ Full alignment with data protection regulations
✅ No-code visual customisations
✅ Advanced CSS options
✅ Features designed to enable growth
✅ Mobile-first design
✅ Team collaboration

### **ACCESS THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THE WORLD’S BIGGEST BRANDS**

**Motive Commerce Search** is built on the technology of **[Empathy.co](https://empathy.co)**, which provides some of the world's largest online retailers with their search. **Motive Commerce Search** has taken this same technology and made it available for any sized shop.

That means search that is affordable with features that have been carefully developed with the needs of your shop and customers in mind.

**WHEN WE SAY FEATURE-PACKED, WE REALLY DO MEAN IT!**

* **Privacy-first analytics** → Discover your most popular products and new market opportunities without collecting or tracking your customers' information. 
* **Boost & Bury rules** → Adapt your sales to your goals by highlighting promoted items at the top of the results page and hiding those you want to give less visibility to.
* **Instant insights** → Check stock levels, monitor trends, and optimise your store without leaving your shop’s search bar.
* **Synonyms for relevant results** → Ensure relevant results by setting up the synonyms tool for shoppers that ask for the same product using different terms.
* **Typo tolerant** → Shoppers misspelling products will still find what they're looking for.
* **Many sites, one search tool** → Set up, customise and manage the search of all your company's sites from the same place.
* **No-code visual customisations** → Display your brand identity across the whole search layer adding your font, colours, logo and more.
* **Move inventory and promote specific products** → Use the banners feature to position your offers in front of even more eyes.
* **Popular products** → Shoppers see your most popular products when they click the search box, allowing them to jump directly to your most popular products in less steps and complete their purchases even faster.
* **Instant results** → Shoppers see results from the moment they click the search box for a more engaging experience.
* **Customisable product cards** → Configure how you want to visually display your products in your shoppers' search results.
* **Easily order how filters are displayed** → Improve the shopping experience by changing the order filters are displayed to shoppers in search results.
* **Redirections** → Shoppers often search for terms like Help, Returns or Shop Locations. With Redirections, easily send your customers to non-product pages from your search.
* **Mobile version included** → Shoppers can search on any device without you paying more. Included in all plans.

**GREATER TRUST = BETTER RESULTS**

At Motive, we do things differently from other search plugins. Simply put, we don't ask you to collect your customers' data, and we don't use that data to serve your competitors. 
We believe in creating ethical search that builds trust. That's why Motive Commerce Search helps you:

* **Boost revenue:** Businesses that generate trust are 1.6x more likely to boost revenue and EBIT growth rates by 10% or more (Source: McKinsey)
* **Add value:** Shoppers now value trust almost as much as price, and on a par with delivery times. (Source: McKinsey)
* **Respect customer data:** A majority of consumers now look specifically for businesses that have a reputation for protecting their data. (Source: McKinsey)

Customer data is a driving force for loyalty and steady growth. The **Retail Trust Index** from [www.ethicalalliance.co](https://www.ethicalalliance.co/) gives some interesting results regarding this:

* **74% of consumers** believe online tracking practices are intrusive.
* **80% of consumers**  are aware online shops track and use their online browsing history.
* **Transparency, clear data privacy policies** and **cybersecurity** are the most important factors to trust online brands.

**FULLY TRANSPARENT WITH NO SURPRISES**

* **One flat rate with no hidden extras:** Choose the pricing plan that matches your shop's size, goals and needs.
* **Full access to all features:** No matter what plan you select, you'll have access to all features, with upgrades and support included.
* **Search that's priced by… searches!** Don't be stung by a provider that charges by requests. With Motive Commerce Search, you pay by what matters most to your and your shoppers: searching and finding.
* **Dedicated customer support:** A team of real people to help you with any questions you may have. 
* **Search that's never switched off**: Motive Commerce Search will never switch off your service, even if your shop outperforms the plan you've purchased.

### **BENEFITS FOR YOUR SHOPPERS**

✅ Find what they're looking for quickly and as part of an enjoyable online shopping experience.
✅ Avoid frustrating shopping experiences while also discovering new products.
✅ Feel confident and safe that their data is not being tracked, collected or shared.
✅ Make your shop's search an online shop assistant that can show shoppers exactly what they’re looking for, intuitively and efficiently.
